Simple code snippets for accessing Oracle SGA.

This is code I use in some of my presentations on Oracle. As such, their in their nature simple code snippets, not a proper, full-blown developed nor tested product. You are welcome to take them, but you will need a lot of further work to make them usable in a proper software product.
