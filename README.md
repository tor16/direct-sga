# direct-sga
Simple code snippets for accessing Oracle SGA.

This is code I use in some of my presentations on Oracle. As such, their in their nature simple code snippets, not a proper, full-blown developed nor tested product. You are welcome to take them, but you will need a lot of further work to make them usable in a proper software product.

read_SGA: attach to instance SGA and read specified memory range
read_cursor_context: attach to a server process running a query and get cursor context of the query
